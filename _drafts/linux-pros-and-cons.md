### Linux pros
 
- Linux distros make the most of old hardware. Whereas my 2011 MacBook pro can barely chug along running the latest macOS, a similar HP ProBook with 1/3 the memory feels downright snappy running [Cub Linux](https://cublinux.com/).
- Command line feels like a 1st class citizen.
- The tech stack you're using to develop is more similar to the tech stack of the server to which you eventually deploy.

### Linux cons

- This is the flip side of having a development tech stack that matches your production environment: you will be primarily testing the website you build on an OS that matches virtually none of your users. Also, no [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html), which has become my primary browser. 
- No native Google Drive. Not having folders synced up with the cloud is a major drawback.
- No Creative Cloud. I would be more tempted to reach for something like [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/editor/, 'Pixlr photo editor') than Gimp to do any quick and dirty photo editing or mockups. (Granted, Photoshop and Illustrator have become less a part of my design flow as I've started to use [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) as a primary design tool.
