title: SpinupWP Review
---
I was testing out a couple of different platforms and server setups for my WordPress clients. I tried out SpinupWP to help manage a DigitalOcean droplet ($15 plan with 1 GB memory and 3 vCPUs). I ended up going with Pantheon for a few reasons:

1. Pantheon offers a dev URL for newly created sites, which makes the workflow of setting up a testing version of a site for a full redesign really smooth; I have a URL to share with the client before we are ready to flip the switch on redirecting their domain. 

2. The WordPress backend felt a lot faster on Pantheon. The WP backend for the site I created through SpinupWP felt sluggish, and didn't feel as fast as some WP sites I had set up myself on cheaper DigitalOean droplets.

3. Transferring control over to the client feels like it is going to be a lot easier with Pantheon. At the end of the day, I'm a frontend dev without any interest in hosting client websites myself, and Pantheon allows me to turn full control of a server over to a client once the project is done. If I ever decide to host sites for clients, I'm going to take a look at SpinupWP again. It's a promising platform, and I overall really liked the functionality it does offer.

I realize Patheon is a lot more expensive than the SpinupWP/DigitalOcean combo I was testing it against, so it's not really a fair comparison. I was just doing my due diligence to maybe save my client a buck. Again, I may check out SpinupWP again in the future if the need arises.
