The current design of this site (launched in late 2016) was designed and developed on a HP ProBook running the Chromixium Linux distro. Here are a few observations: 

### Linux pros
 
- Linux distros can make the most of old hardware. Whereas my 2011 MacBook pro can barely chug along running the latest macOS, a similar HP ProBook with 1/3 the memory feels downright snappy running Chromixium (now [Cub Linux](https://cublinux.com/)).
- Command line feels like a 1st-class citizen, whatever that means. Seems like I had to install less crap before I got developing (I'm looking at you, Xcode). 
- The tech stack I'm using to develop is more similar to the tech stack of the server to which I will eventually deploy. This is more true when working on WordPress sites. This redesign of my site is on GitHub pages, so no server tomfoolery required. 

### Linux cons

- This is the flip side of having a development tech stack that matches my production environment: I find myself primarily testing the website on an OS that matches virtually none of my users. 
- No [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html), which is typically my main browser. 
- No native Google Drive. Not having folders synced up with the cloud is a drawback.
- No Creative Cloud. Honestly, not having Photoshop and Illustrator hasn't been as much of a bother as I thought it would be since I'm trying to use [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) as my primary design tool. When needing to do any quick and dirty mock-ups or photo edits, I've found myself reaching for the web-based [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/editor/, 'Pixlr photo editor') more often than Gimp.
