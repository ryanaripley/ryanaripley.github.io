The most recent design of this site (launched early 2017) was primarily designed and developed on a HP ProBook running the Chromixium Linux distro. Here are a few observations. 

### Linux pros
 
- Linux distros can make the most of old hardware. Whereas my 2011 MacBook pro can barely chug along running the latest macOS, an HP ProBook of similar vintage with 1/3 the memory feels downright snappy running Chromixium.
- The command line feels like a 1st-class citizen, whatever that means. Seems like I spent less time installing software than on macOS (I'm looking at you, Xcode). And it's really no comparison Linux versus trying to use a Unix-based tech stack on Windows. 
- The setup I'm using to develop is more similar to the tech stack of the server to which I will eventually deploy. This is more true when working on WordPress sites. This redesign of my site is on GitHub pages, so no server tomfoolery required. 

### Linux cons

- The flip side of having a dev stack that matches my production environment is that I'm primarily testing websites on an OS that matches very few of my users.  
- No native Google Drive. Not having folders synced up with the cloud is a drawback. I find myself doing a lot of downloading and reuploading. Dropbox does work, so if I had gone down the Dropbox path rather than Drive, it wouldn't be an issue.
- No Creative Cloud. Honestly, not having Photoshop and Illustrator isn't much of a handicap when it comes to design since I've started to use [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) as my primary design tool. When I miss Photoshop is when I need to do any photo editing and resizing. I played around with the web-based PS-clone [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/editor/, 'Pixlr photo editor'), but have been more often reading for [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/).
