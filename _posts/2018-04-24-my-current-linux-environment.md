I recently started fresh with a new install of [Linux Mint][Linux Mint], and I wanted to record my current web development environment.

## Hardware

Homebuilt desktop machine with:

- Intel Core i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00Ghz
- 32GB RAM
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 Ti (3GB)

## Operating systems

I'm set up to dual boot with Windows 10 and [Linux Mint][Linux Mint] 18.1 Cinnamon. Windows is on its own 256GB SSD, and Mint on a 240GB SSD I found on sale at Microcenter. (I took a chance on Microcenter's in-house brand Inland Professional, which has paid off so far.) Thanks to the dual SSDs, both operating systems boot quickly. 

## Linux Mint look and feel
