[Banfill-Locke Center for the Arts][banfill], started in 1979, is a nonprofit community art center located on the Missippi River in an historic farmhouse and tavern. 

### Project goals

1. Create a new logo and brand identity that could be used across Banfill-Locke's digital and print materials
2. Redesign Banfill-Locke's aging and non-responsive website and make the switch to WordPress so the site would be easier for staff to update
3. Integrate the new website with [CiviCRM][civicrm], an open source donor, membership and event management software
