Leadership coach Jean Johnson approached me to refresh the design of her existing WordPress site, and also review the content across all pages. Her old site had been through a few different redesigns, and much of the content was repetitive, inconsistent, or outdated. 

My process began with by pulling all of the site content into a single Google document. I edited and refined the content, distilling the number of pages from nearly twenty to a lean and focused five. Jean and I worked together on several revisions of this content until we were both happy with the consistency, directness, and warmth of her message.

I then took this content and designed a custom WordPress theme to match. Using Advanced Custom Fields, I was able to provide Jean the ability to edit ever word of content on her site from within the WordPress admin, even though content is split up into various layout components on each page.

> Ryanâ€™s approach made updating my website much easier than I expected! His approach really supported getting a clear message, good content and graphics to get everything just like I wanted.
