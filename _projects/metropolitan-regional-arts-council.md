This project took places over two phases. First, I consulted with staff at [Metropolitan Regional Arts Council](https://mrac.org) to help them move their previous website, built on a host-provided content builder, over to WordPress.com. I customized their theme, but it became apparent that they would need more custom functionality than the theme provided. In phase two, I built them a custom WordPress theme.

The MRAC site uses Advanced Custom Fields and a variety of custom post types to make it easier for staff to manage content on the website.
