[The North Central Division][ncacda] of the American Choral Directors Association is one of seven geographic divisions of the association formed in 1959 to promote excellence in choral music.

One of the main resources provided by the North Central Division is their quarterly newsletter  *Melisma*, written by a volunteer editorial board. The division was interested in moving the newsletter to an online format, so I designed and built a WordPress site that would allow them to add and edit their own newsletter content.
