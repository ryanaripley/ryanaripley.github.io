Between fiscal years 2014 and 2017, I designed the annual reports for the [Playwrights' Center][pwc], an organization that serves playwrights through new play development and financial support. 

## 2016-17 annual report

For the 2016-17 report, I refined the design from the previous year, updating it to match the graphic design of that season's print materials.

## 2015-16 annual report

For the 2015-16 report, I designed a layout that interweaves statistics, brief narrative sections, and quotes from the Center's writers. On desktop, the right half of the screen cycles through images from the year while you scroll through the report on the left.

## 2014-15 annual report

For the 2014-15 annual report, I designed longer narrative sections that expanded the scope of the typically stat-heavy report. This allowed the report to showcase milestones from the Center's year and share personal stories from constituents about the Center's impact.

## 2013-14 annual report

This was the first year the Playwrights' Center went from a printed annual report to one that was exclusively digital. I created a single page mini-site that showcased all of the Center's important statistics from 2013-14.
