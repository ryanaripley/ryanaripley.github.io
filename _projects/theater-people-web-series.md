[*Theater People*][theater people] is a comedy web series, filmed in Minneapolis/St. Paul, about the world of independent theater and the people who occupy it. 

I designed their logo:

{% include image.html name="tp-logo.jpg" alt="Logo created for Theater People web series" %}

And built their website:

{% include browser_example.html desktop="tp-desktop.jpg" mobile="tp-mobile.jpg" alt="Website design for the Theater People web series" %}
