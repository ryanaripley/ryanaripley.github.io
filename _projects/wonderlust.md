In 2013, the [Playwrights&rsquo; Center][pwc] hosted a large fundraiser and live auction at the Aria event space in Minneapolis. 

I built a mini-site for the event that provided all of the necessary information about the venue, tickets, parking, available auction packages, and cast of the evening's program. I adapted the design from print materials created for the invite.
