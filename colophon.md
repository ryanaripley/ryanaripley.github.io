## Jekyll

This website is built with [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosted on [GitHub Pages][github pages].

For images, I adapted a method described by [Eduardo Boucas][boucas] to organize assets used in pages, posts and other collections into folders.


## Fonts

[Merriweather][merriweather] and [Open Sans][open sans], served up using Google Fonts.
