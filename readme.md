Personal porfolio website for Ryan A. Ripley.

### Hero images

For each page, post, project or any other collection, an image folder should be created in `assets/content/{collection}/{title slug}/`

The default hero images can be saved to `assets/layout/default_hero_1400.jpg` and it will be used on all views that don't set a hero image in front matter.
